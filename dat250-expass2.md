# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

In this assignement I have succesfully done some initial experimenting with JPA, set up a database using Apache Derby and studied object-relational mapping. 


Derby 10.14.2.0 was installed and tested by completing the tutorial given in the assignement:

Note: I had an unresolved issue were if i used Junit 5, an error message conatining: <i> No test found using Junit 5 </i> , changing to Junit 4 is a temporary solution. 


## Other unresolved issues

Trying to inspect the database and table
